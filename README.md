# Sports App
This is an app showing the stats of players of a match. On the main page, the list of the two teams' top players are listed.
Tapping on the image of the player will bring you to a more detailed page of that particular player's stats of their last game. This will show stats such as goals, kicks, offsides, etc.

# Issues
The endpoint for downloading the images and the default image was not working. So I have just downloaded a random default image from the internet and have set it as the image of the players.

# Scope Reduction
For the sake of delivering the project in a timely manner, I have not placed importance on error handling scenarios.
